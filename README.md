# Pokéfinder

This application is a simple version of Pokédex.<br/>
**I wrote this to learn how to use:**
- Dagger 2
- Room
- Retrofit
- Mockito & Unit tests
- Gson
- Recycler View
- MVP pattern

**I additionally used the following technologies:**
- Stetho
- Picasso
- JsonToKotlinClass

**About the project:**<br/>
I created only one activity to focus only on new technologies.

In this project, I implemented a Room database to insert the last searched pokemons.<br/>
This database is used when a device has a problem with an Internet connection.

I used AsyncTask and callbacks to handle asynchronous functions.
